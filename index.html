				<p class="intro">
					Splitter is a project that addresses a common but yet unsolved
					problem and presents a possible solution that makes existing implementations
					in advanced 3D games look bad. We have developed a
					unique glass-breaking algorithm that is designed to run sufficiently
					fast to be used in demanding applications such as high-paced 3D
					action games.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>
					Even today, when realistic physics and sophisticated 3D graphics are important
					parts of many popular computer games, there is no well-known serious
					attempt to simulate the breaking of glass in real-time. Instead, developers
					settle with static animations or predefined crack patterns which may appear
					acceptable in some applications but nevertheless are unrealistic and a sometimes
					disturbing element in an otherwise appealing game experience.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Goal</h3>
				<p>
					We wanted to develop a simple, fast and reasonably correct physical simulation
					of crack pattern generation and loose-piece detection in breaking glass.
					The aim was for it to run in real-time on a standard PC.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Result</h3>
				<p>
					We were told that the identification of loose pieces probably couldn't be performed
					in real-time. Nevertheless, the resulting application solves this problem
					in almost no time at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall our project has recieved very positive reactions from various people at
					the university. We are very pleased with the result and believe that the method
					used in our prototype could dramatically improve the visual impact of games
					and other 3D applications.

					To provide all the information about the project, we have included links to the
					project abstract and report as well as the compiled application (Windows platform only).
					The source code is available as an appendix in the report.
					The manual for the application is also downloadable.
